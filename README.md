# Why Reinventing the Wheels?
> An Empirical Study on Code Reuse and Re-implementation

### Research questions
- RQ1: Why do developers replace their self-implemented method with an ex- ternal library method?
- RQ2: Why do developers replace an external library method with their self- implemented code?
- RQ3: How can we improve the current library recommendation techniques?

### File description
- **analytic_scripts** folder: contains script to extract code reuse and re-implementation cases for Android apps and Python apps.
- **real_world_examples** folder: contains the results obtained by running the scripts in **analytic_scripts**.
- **commit_messages** folder: contains the manual classification results on the motivation of code reuse and re-implementations for the data in **real_world_examples**.
